# machine-learning-curriculum
Erik Sherman's machine learning curriculum
(inspired by [Siraj Raval's](https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months) and [Christos Zonios'](https://howicodestuff.github.io/machine_learning/2018/01/12/a-roadmap-to-machine-learning.html)). 

This curriculum is meant to meant for beginner / intermediate programmers to go from little to no data science knowledge to general knowledge of the basics of machine learning and being able to understand and implement various ML algorithms to solve real-world problems. 

* linear algebra ([intuition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab "3Blue1Brown's series")
and [main course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/ "MIT course")) 

* [web programming with python and javascript] (https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript "CS50 course") (this is included so that we are able to create a GUI for apps and projects that we make)

* python and data science basics ([intro](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud359 "Udacity's intro to data science") and [main course](https://www.edx.org/course/python-for-data-science "GIT's course on edX"))

* machine learning
 * [intro to ML Udacity] (https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)
 * [Andrew NG's machine learning course]
(https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) this course is more math heavy and goes into the implementation of the algorithms. People who have taken the course recommend to write the assignments in python instead of octave to avoid having to learn another programming language and spending all your time debugging foreign code.


* extra: [Andrew NG's deep learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) (in python!) to take your machine learning knowledge to the next level with deep learning
