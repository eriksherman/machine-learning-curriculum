# machine-learning-curriculum
Erik Sherman's machine learning curriculum
(inspired by [Siraj Raval's](https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months) and [Christos Zonios'](https://howicodestuff.github.io/machine_learning/2018/01/12/a-roadmap-to-machine-learning.html)). 

This curriculum is meant for beginner / intermediate programmers to go from little to no data science knowledge to a solid general knowledge of machine learning algorithms and how to understand and implement them to solve real-world problems.

* [web programming with python and javascript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T382hIW-IsOVuXP1uMzEvmcE5 "CS50 course") (this is included so that we are able to create a GUI for apps and projects that we make)

* [linear algebra intuition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab "3Blue1Brown's series")
  * it is helpful to know the basics and build and intuition to linear algebra concepts, as they will come up in data science and machine learning

* data science
  * [pandas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDc-3szzjeP6N6b0aDrrKyL-)
  * [matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7Bo_J8x_dw&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfefDfXb9Yf0la1fPDKluPF)

* machine learning
  * [practical machine learning with python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGxgnH8y2NM&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)
  * [Andrew NG's machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
    * this course is more math heavy and goes into the implementation of the algorithms
    * people who have taken the course recommend to write the assignments in python instead of octave to avoid having to learn another programming language and spending all your time debugging foreign code.


* deep learning: [Andrew NG's deep learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) (in python!) to take our machine learning knowledge to the next level with deep learning
